    <p class="lead">
      I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://pharmacy.wisc.edu/academics/pharmsci/">School of Pharmacy</a>
      at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My current research is focused on model development for compositional data
      applied to the
      microbiome, advised by
      <a href="https://kwanlab.github.io/">Prof. Jason Kwan </a>.
      More generally, my research objectives emphasize the development of user-friendly, statistically sound, and
      open-source software that addresses practical scientific challenges and empowers non-statisticians/data scientists
      to work more directly with their data.
      My research is supported by an
      <a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. <br />
      <br />
      Outside of research, I prioritize statistics education and initiatives related to equity.
      My teaching objectives emphasize undergraduate statistics education and teaching statistical literacy and best
      practices to non-statisticians.
      Inside and outside of my teaching, I actively try to leverage my position to advocate for and work towards
      building more equitable communities and cultures within statistics, as well as STEM and academia more broadly, at
      all levels.
      <br />
      <br />
      Before coming to UW, I was an undergraduate at <a href=" https://www.macalester.edu/">Macalester College</a>
      where I received degrees in statistics and economics.
